# Customer Retention Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project explores the factors that encourage customers to stay with a company over time. By analyzing customer behavior, service details, and contract information, we aim to understand what keeps customers loyal. The insights from this analysis can help businesses improve retention strategies and build long-term customer relationships.

##  Objective
To identify the key reasons customers remain with the company, using data cleaning, outlier detection, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

##  Dataset

##  Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

##  Data Cleaning
- Converted string-type numerical fields to numeric values
- Replaced blanks and handled missing data
- Detected and removed outliers from numerical columns. 

##  Analysis Performed
- Visualized relationships between key features and customer retention
- Explored the impact of contract type, tenure,senior citizen and gender on customer loyalty
